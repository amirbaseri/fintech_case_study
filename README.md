## Overview and Origin
---
This Case Study will focused on **Point Home Equity** within the Real Estate / Mortgage fintech doamain.  

According to information provided by the Better Business Bureau ([BBB][1]), Point Home Equity was founded on August 11, 2014 and incorporated as Point Digital Finance, Inc. on November 12, 2014 in the state fo Delaware.   


 The company was founded by Eddie Lim, Founder and Cheif Executive Officer and Eoin Matthews, Founder and Cheif Business Officer. ([Point][2])  


 Having previously spoken to one of the founders, Eoin Matthews, he had shared with me his own personal struggles in financing a home in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Silicon Valley. Furthermore "from failed efforts to refinance our homes to being "beaten" out from buying a home repeatedly in the San Francisco Bay Area, [the team] has experienced first hand the failings of a system skewed by debt financing." ([Point][2])  


The company, to this point, has been venture and investor backed.  According to [Crunchbase][3], over 4 funding rounds Point Home Equity has raised $30.4 million in venture backed funding. The most recent funding round occured on March, 20, 2019 where the company raised $22 million dollars ([Crunchbase][4]). Some of the more notable investors in the company are Andreessen Horowitz, Bloomberg Beta, and Prudential Financial.

## Business Activities

### **The Business Problem** 

A recent article by Louis Hansen published in the [San Jose Mercury News][5] on August 31, 2020 paints a picture of the Bay Area housing market.  Hansen article contends that, even during the Covid-19 Pandemic, Bay Area median home prices have risen on average 8.6% specifically in Contra Costa and San Mateo Counties.

This increase pricing trend has been continuous and ongoing since the trough of the Great Ression creating a very tight and competitive housing market. As with all things, California has led first.  But this trend is not specific to California.  The State of the Nation's Housing Report 1988-2018, published by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies identified the following insights and burdens on households:


>"The cost-burdened share of renters doubled from
23.8 percent in the 1960s to 47.5 percent in 2016 as housing costs and household incomes steadily diverged, with the largest increases occurring in the 2000s. Adjusting for inflation, the median rent payment rose 61 percent between 1960 and 2016 while the median renter income grew only 5 percent (Figure 6). The pattern for homeowners is similar, with the median home value increasing 112 percent and the median owner income rising only 50 percent" ([Harvard Housing Study | page 5][6]).

As housholds spend more of their earnings for their housing payments and expenses, they are most often left with little savings. 

When these huseholds do decide to purchase their first home, they most often end up placing all their assets, with the exception of what they are required to have for qualification purposes, into the transaction to pay for the down payments, closing costs and reserves. Most homeowners see this significant outlay as a good investment as they understand that their properity will appreciate over time and are willing to put all of their funds into their property.  However this creates  a situation where people do not have much savings left for other unexpected expenses or financial shocks over time. Moreover, these new homeowners are left with financing these expected or unexpected expenses through dept financing which adds another monthly expense to a tight household budget.  And this is the financial problem that Point has set out to address in an innovative fashion. 

### **Target Client and Market Potential**

In an article written by Ben Shiller for [Fast Company](7) co-founder Eoin Matthews takes the position that it is more advantagous for potential clients to get the Point home equity product than a traditional home equity loan because a traditional home equity loan will just add to the the borrowers debt load. Matthews goes on to share that "there are no equity products in the biggest asset class in the world-American real estate-and there's no reason that should be"...."You are not just replacing debt with debt. [With Point] You are actually applying equity to paying off student loans, unsecured loans, and credit cards"([Fast Company][7]). The comapany is focused on using it's fractional home ownership model to help it's target client: homeowners in distress. 

According to [CoreLogic][8], year over year, homeowners with esisting mortgages saw a combined $590.1 billion increase in their equity between 2019 and 2020.  These figures translate to 6.5% equity gain over that period.  Per [Statista][9], as of March 2020, US homeowners have an available equity of $18.72 trillion in equity.  Furthermore, since the Great Recession (2010), homeowners have gained a total of $6.16 trillion in equity.  The above figures support a very robust market opportunity for fractional hownownership and investment.  The key benefit and differentiator that comes with an equity investment is that the client, in exchange for a portion of the future appreciation of the property's value will receive a significant cash infusion without the burden of the monthly payment associated with traditional home equity products.  

For these customers, Point is willing to provide an equity investment in the range of $35,000 to $350,000 based on their property value. This investment is good for 10 years or until the owner decides to sell their home.  At which point, based on the the appreciation or depreciation of the property value,  Point will particiapte in the gains or losses over time.  A client can also buy  back their equity from point at anytime they chose.  

### **Is it Tech or a New Way of Doing Business?**

Point is a blend of modern technology as well as a new way of looking at an old product and how to manage that risk associated with financing real property. 

According to [Builtwith][10], Point uses the following technologes as of September 2020:

Point has deployed it's technology and is laser focused on providing an outstanding and user experience for it's business to consumer model.  The technology makes it easy to capture data, track user behavior as well as present a new to the wolrd idea which is not so simple, in an easy to understand and secure manner.  The company demonstrates a focus on continous improvement of the user journey as well as the experience of its investors who proivde financing for Points equity investments. 

It is important to mention that Point's approach to tapping equity in real property is the most unique part of their business. Another key differentiator is their rsk model's focus on assessing the risk based on property and market versus soley focusing on the the credit and ability to repay of the borrower profile which is the accepted industry norm of traditional residential lending.

## Landscape

---

According to [CB Insights][12], Point Home Equity is within the Real Estate and Mortage financial technology domain.  In, 2020, Point Home Equity was ranked as one of top 250 fintech companies for 2020.  The real estate and mortgage domain as defined by [CB Insights][12] is quite diverese and inclusive of startup that either do direct to consumer lending and provide software as a serviceS (SaaS) to other direct to consumer institutions.   From a funding perspecitive Figure Technologies is the most well-funded  company within the catagory. Figure provides a more traditioanl home equity solution and is currently at Series C funding round.  Moreover, as of December 2019, Figure has raised over $1.4 billion in venture capital  with a valuation range of $1 - $10 billion dollars ([Crunchbase][13]).  

### **Trends with in the Real Estate and Mortgage Domain**

The trends within the Real Estate and Mortgage domain can be broken down into the following key themes:
>
> 1. New technology companies that are born to reimagine the end to end lending process within the domain, and at the same time, looking to unseat the incumbants.
>    * Some examples in this area are [Better.com][14], [LendingHome.com][15], and [Figure][16].
> 2. New to world SaaS companies that are mordernizing manual workflows and enhancing the users digital excperieince. These companies are focused on B2B growth.
>    * [Blend][17] is an example of a Saas provder to lenders.  Their main technology is an enhanced point of sales (POS) to streamline the aplicaiton and documentation collection process.  
>    * [Snapdoc's][18] software helps simplify and improve the digital loan closing process.   
> 3. New ways of solving old problems using data.  
>    * Almost all key fintech companies within the domain fall in this catagory for somepart of thier process. 

These entrants over the past 5 to 10 years have placed significant pressure on encombants to enhance and improve their user experience and gain efficencies either through their own technology development or aquisition of technology providers.  The first major salvo occured in 2016 with the introduction of [ROCKETMortgage][19] with thier now well known [Super Bowl ad][20] placement for their new mortgage experience.

## Results
---

Point is not a direct lender or bank.  Because of its nature, the start up has a significantly less compliance burden than if it was.  As a draw back, Point has to rely on investors to not only invest in their business but also invest in there new equity investment model.   There is no reocrd of financial performance as it is still an early start up.  Date point has raised investable assets for financing equity investments totaling $272 million.   

It is unfortunetly too early to determine if the company is successful in it's business model.  Real estate markets are quite cyclical. Companies like Point in the equity investment space have not experienced an economic downturn so it is difficult to predict how this assset class will perfrom in an environment with depreciating property valuations.  Second, another concern would be the appetiite for investors to participate with Point during such an economic condition.  This risk would impact the companies abilty to access funds for their equity positions in people's homes.  

In looking at the domain in general there is not a lot of information on KPIs.  As a potential investor some of the key KPIs I would like ot know as they become available are:
>* Total dollars invested in equity positons.
>* Number of houlseholds helped.  
>* Average return on equity investment for the portfolio.
>* What percentage of the investments default.
>* Which geographies are experiencing declining values and how does that impact the portfolio.  
>* What is the accuracy of the asset forecasting model and how has it changed overtime.  


## Recommendations

In review, Point has done a good job in investing in individuals who own their current home.  Below would be my recommendations to the company:

1. I would recommend based on competitor activity to create a similar vertical for Homebuyers and invest in equity during this prcoess.  There is demand in this space due to the cost of ownership in certian high cost geographies.

2. Second,  I would consider opening this equity oppertunity up to individual investors.  Currently, their are similar opportunities to fractionaly invest in investment or commercial properties.  I would look to see if this is viable based on current typical investment terms. By pooling fractions of loans with different seasoning and maturity dates, the risk can be significantly reduced to individuals and institutional investors alike.  

3.  Third,  I would consider speaking to housing authorities as well as employers as they have provded similar home financing for low to moderate income individuals or employees within their communities.   These organisation could be potential funding investors and Point could provide the serivice and receive compensation on a transactional basis.   

4.  Lastly,  blockchain could be utilized on the secondary side to provide realtime secure portfolio analytics to the investors as well as market perspectus reports. 

Some of these technologies are already in practice  in similar fintech domains/businesses and some competitors alike.   However, great ideas rely on great execution and that can be a differentiator as well.
